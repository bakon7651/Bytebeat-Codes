// This entire file is also playable there, which you can comment out each line
// to mute its output.
//
// These techniques, pioneered by an ex-AYCE member, mainly based on an idea
// that each channels summing into the final output are structured as follows:
//
// [Phase generator] (* [Mute bit]) & [Volume/Filter]
//
// - Phase generator: This generates a tone based on input sample number t.
// - Mute bit:        This determines when to mute the channel for rest notes
//                    and silent bars by outputting 0 or 1.
// - Volume/Filter:   This limits the volume and modifies phase generator's
//                    sawtooth waveform by disallowing some bits through an
//                    AND mask. Resulting in some kind of bit-crush effect.
//                    Note that period, volume and octave are all affected
//                    by the highest bit position of this part's value.
// 
// All 3 parts can be controlled by loops generated with this expression,
// which allows fitting short list of small numbers in only one number
//
// [Bit table] >> ([Counter] << [Width]) & ((1 << [Width]) - 1)
//
// Note the missing `& 31` needed to make the right shift periodic,
// since JS conveniently applies it for us already, somehow...

// Noise hats
// The phase generator part is essentially a very fast frequency sweep down
// with a period of a note frequency instead. Noise sounds are made as a result
// of different divisor values in each period, similar to how some PRNGs work.
// Different envelope speed, volume and patterns are a result of AND-ing the
// output with 3 counters running at different speeds. The selection of 128
// bars ramp up and volume mask of 63 was actually unintentional. But it was
// nice enough to keep it as the second half of the song.
